# X230TabletRotationFix
This script fixes a issue on the Lenovo Thinkpad X230 Tablet with Ubuntu Mate (22.10).
If you use the hardware button to rotate the screen, the screen rotates but the pen and touch device keeps it current orientation.
This script will identify the current orientation of the screen and rotates the pen and touch device accordently.
You can use a custom shortcut to fire that script every time this hardware button is pressed.
Have fun this still awesome machine! :D
